Last year, I went on a summer vacation to visit Berlin for the first time.
One of my favorite parts of the vacation was trying German cuisine, where the bratwurst was delicious.
I found Melhase at the baeckerei eating all of the brot!
I then left the baeckerei in my BMW and made my way to the flughafen.
I then saw a sign for a Ratskeller, so I pulled over to go in.
On my way in, I saw a hungry Hund so I gave it some Brot from the baeckerei.
